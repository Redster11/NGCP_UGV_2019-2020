For naming:

-Summary: changed load code(overall description)

-Description: what was changed and why



For Coding:

-top of every file put a description of what file is used for and relevant to (like an application, dependencies etc)
-relevant variable names should have relevant names so easy to identify and not all named x (for ease of confusion)
-not useful to give specific names to counter or loop variables
-comment what variable each should be(int, string...etc)
-could structure your main by separating all the class calls and other things together for readability
-top of each function comment what is inputted and outputted(list arguments and returns)
