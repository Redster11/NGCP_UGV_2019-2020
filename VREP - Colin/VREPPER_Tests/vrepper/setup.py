long_description="""If you have Python and V-Rep the robot simulator 
software installed, why not combine both? This library let's you 
access the V-Rep API in a bit more humane way the native implementation 
(V-Rep ships with its own Python API, but it's a bit harder to use). 
This library gives you a lot of convenience and includes an example for 
OpenAI Gym integration. This codebase is an extension of ctmakro's
https://github.com/ctmakro/vrepper who provided all the basic functions -
so without their effort this wouldn't have been possible.
